You can then toggle each GPIO on/off, and drive DELs for example, using a simple graphical user interface.\r\n\r\nYou will find a pre-built jar in the dist/ folder. It needs to be run as root.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd Pi4jDemo/dist/\r\n$ sudo java -jar Pi4jDemo.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n// TODO: add an img of the GUI\r\n\r\n// TOOD: add a video/img of the circuit board","name":"Pi4jdemo"}
